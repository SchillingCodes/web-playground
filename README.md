# Firebase + Create React App Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Description

This is a basic user management and profile management application using Firebase for these services. The following requirements are fulfilled by this application:
- Each user can have up to 3 profiles
- Profiles are named when created
- Profiles can be deleted
- Users can "switch" between profiles
- Clicking the profile name changes the screen text to include the profile name, essentially "logging in" that user to that profile
- Users can register and login to the application

User registration has been disabled, but you can use the following credentials to test:
Username: Test2@example.com
Password: Test123!

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to practice building a React application and using Firebase services to manage users and their data.
